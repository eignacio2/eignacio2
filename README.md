About_Ethan_Ignacio

Hello! I'm Ethan Ignacio, a programmer very passionate about AI and frontend development who is currently studying Computer Science at UIC. The big part about coding that truly interests me is the ability to make my ideas slowly but surely come to life as an app or website. I'm experienced in the code I write, but I'm always hungry to learn more and hone my skills whenever possible.

Some things that I will be working on this summer will be ranging from creating a connect 4 java app, to continuing to hone my skills on LeetCode!
